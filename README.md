# Quelle
Quelle is a specification. The most generic form of the spec is known as Vanilla-Quelle. As Quelle is a being proposed as a standard for search across various domains, tailoring for specific domains will inevitable produce various dialects. It is recommended that each dialect conform to the Vanilla-Quelle specification. A user-manual-of-sorts is provided here:

[https://github.com/kwonus/Quelle/blob/main/VanillaQuelle.md](https://github.com/kwonus/Quelle/blob/main/Vanilla-Quelle.md)

For the time being, that is also the most complete specification. It is a specification-by-example (SBE). A [PEG](Parsing_expression_grammar) Grammar is provided in the reference Rust implementation of Vanilla-Quelle:

[https://github.com/kwonus/Quelle/blob/main/rust/src/quelle.pest](https://github.com/kwonus/Quelle/blob/main/rust/src/quelle.pest)

Every attempt is being made to keep the Quelle syntax agnostic about the search domain, yet the Quelle. Consequently, Quelle syntax has the potential for ubiquity.
